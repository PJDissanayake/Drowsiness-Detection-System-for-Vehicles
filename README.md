# Drowsiness-Detection-System-for-Vehicles

Developed a real-time drowsiness detection system using a Raspberry Pi 4B and camera module to enhance vehicle
safety. Utilized TensorFlow for training and implementing facial feature tracking models to detect signs of driver
fatigue.Employed Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model testing during development. Integrated a siren to
trigger an alert when drowsiness is detected, ensuring timely intervention
